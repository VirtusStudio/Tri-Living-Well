  This  will likely be one of (if not the most) the most demanding exercises in your  workout, 
  as it works a lot of muscle. Be conservative with weight and intensity  increases on this one. 
  If possible, set your seat so that, when you extend your  legs, you stop just short of locking 
  out your knees. This will help keep  continuous tension on the leg muscles. If your leg press 
  allows you to change  the angle of the back pad, experiment. A more upright position tends to  
  concentrate the work on the quadriceps (front of the thigh), while a more  reclined position 
  tends to get the hamstrings and gluteus muscles more  involved, along with the quadriceps.   
  Once you are set, slowly and steadily extend your legs, until you reach  the stopping point of the machine, or until you are just short of locking your  knees out. There is no need for a pause in this position; simply turn the  movement around, slowly and smoothly, until your legs are bent 90 degrees.  Avoid bringing your legs back past this point, as your hips will usually  elevate, and when it is time to press the weight out again, your lower back  will be called upon to pull the hips back down. This is an unsafe position for  the lower back to have to work in.<br />

                      Machine Row</span><br />
                      If  the chest pad of your machine is adjustable, set it so that your arms can fully  extend, but so that you only have a slight reach beyond this. This will enable  you to easily set the weight down when your set is over. Most people start this  movement with their arms, which means they get a great biceps (and to some  degree, shoulder) workout, but not much back work. Try instead to initiate  things by drawing your shoulders back and inward. This doesn’t always come  naturally, so try this (without using any weight): imagine someone has their  hand on your back. Try to squeeze the hand with your shoulder blades. Do this a  few times, until you feel like you have some control over this movement, then  do the same thing on the row machine. Grip the handles with your hands, draw  your shoulders back and your shoulder blades inward. Once you have drawn  shoulders and shoulder blades as far back and in as possible, finish the  movement by bending your arms/drawing your elbows back behind you. Don’t lean  back and away from the chest pad, as this transfers the work from the upper  back/shoulders/arms to the lower back. Once you’ve reached the point where you  can no longer draw your elbows back any farther, pause in this contracted  position for a moment. Then, extend your arms again, slowly and under control,  until straight. Repeat until your set is finished.<br />

                      If  your machine allows you to adjust your seat height, set this so that when you  pull the handle(s) down toward your chest, they come to a pause at the  mid/lower part of the chest. Grip the handles <em>so that your palms face you</em>. Similar to the machine row, try to  start the movement by moving the shoulders; this time, you’ll move the  shoulders and shoulder blades down, rather than back and inward. Once the  shoulders have moved as  much as  possible, complete the movement by bending the arms and drawing the elbows  behind you. Pause for a moment in the bottom/contracted position, then extend  the arms again, slowly and steadily. Repeat until the set is finished.<br />

                      Position  yourself so that your back is fully supported, firmly against the back pad,  including your lower back. If the seat height on your machine is adjustable,  set this so that the handles are at or slightly below shoulder height (Note: if  you have, or have had, shoulder issues, it may be better to lower the seat a  bit, and set the handles slightly above shoulder height. Please check with your  doctor). If a choice of hand positions is offered, use the handles that allow  your elbows to be closer to your torso. Once you are set, simply press the  weight upward, stopping just short of locking out your elbows. Slowly and  smoothly lower the weight. Just before you reach the absolute bottom position,  press upward again. Repeat until your set is finished.<br />

                      If  possible, position the seat so that your shoulders are level with, or slightly  below your elbows (this will vary, depending on machine design).

For beginners, use either a machine (not so common these days)  or sit on the end of a bench. Place your hands on the bench, just behind you, for  support.

Place your forearms on the pads to either side of you, and lightly  grip the handles. Take your feet off the steps, supporting your weight with  your arms and shoulders. Raise your knees up toward your chest, as high as you  can, and lower until straight. If you can, keep your legs slightly in front of  you, in order to keep tension on the hip flexors at all times.
