<p>Nutrition and diet play an important role in achieving  optimal health, fitness level, and weight.&nbsp;  Variety, moderation, and balance are the keys to healthy eating.&nbsp; Eating nutritiously does not have to be about  deprivation.&nbsp; Deprivation does not work  in the long run.&nbsp; To achieve the  long-term health and weight benefits of good nutrition, it is important to make  a lifestyle change.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Our goal is to offer you the opportunity to enhance your  quality of life through health-promoting dietary and nutritional  practices.&nbsp; We will guide you in changing  unhealthy eating behaviors and in developing a balanced diet for life.&nbsp; Throughout this 6 month program, we will help  you to develop the knowledge base and personal habits critical for optimal  health and fitness level and for successful weight management.&nbsp; The program will guide you in finding the  appropriate amount of calories and nutrients for your body.</p>

<p>We have provided a calorie calculator to help you determine  your daily calorie needs.&nbsp; This  calculation is only an estimate.&nbsp; If you  are unable to achieve your weight goals by following the meal plans provided,  that correspond to your calorie needs (based on the calculation), you may need  to adjust your calorie intake/meal plan and/or exercise regimen or work personally  with a Registered Dietitian for a more individualized plan.</p>
<p>Our goal is to familiarize you with portion sizes, the  appropriate balance of nutrients, and examples of food choices to maximize your  health and achieve your ideal body weight.&nbsp;  Below is a description of the food-balancing program called the  exchange-meal plan.&nbsp; We will guide you in  using this method of meal planning to help you achieve your health and weight  goals.&nbsp; This type of meal plan uses serving  sizes as the building blocks of your diet.</p>
<p>The word exchange refers to the fact that each item on a  particular list may be interchanged with any other food item on the same  list.&nbsp; An exchange can be explained as a  serving, substitution, or choice.&nbsp; For  this plan, foods are divided into six groups/lists:&nbsp; starch, fruit, milk, fat vegetable, and  meat.&nbsp; The plan sets a serving size  (amount) for each food, and, within each group/list, each serving or exchange  has a similar amount of protein, carbohydrates, fat, and calories.</p>
<p>Each of the food groups/lists makes a specific contribution  to the daily diet and it is important to remember that no ONE exchange category  can supply all the nutrients needed for a well-balanced diet.&nbsp; You need to eat foods from all six exchange  lists every day to make sure that your diet is balanced and that you remain  healthy.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The advantage of the exchange-meal plan is that it provides  a system in which a wide selection of foods can be included, thereby offering  variety and versatility.&nbsp; This plan also  provides a framework to group foods with similar carbohydrates, protein, fat,  and caloric content.&nbsp; By selecting a  variety of foods from each of the groups/lists, you are able to incorporate  healthy food choices and balance into your diet.&nbsp; Finally, the exchange-meal plan emphasizes  important management concepts, such as carbohydrate amounts, fat modification,  and calorie control, as well as, accountability.&nbsp; </p>
<p>These are the six Food Exchange Group/Lists:</p>
<p><strong>Starch</strong><br />
    <strong>Fruit</strong><br />
    <strong>Milk</strong><br />
    <strong>Fat</strong><br />
    <strong>Vegetable</strong><br />
    <strong>Meat</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  </table>
<p>Cereals, grains, pasta, breads, crackers, snacks, starchy  vegetables, cooked beans, and peas are on starch list.&nbsp; In general, one starch exchange is a 1/2 cup  cereal, grain, or starchy vegetable; one slice of bread; 1/3 cup of rice or  pasta, or 3/4 cup to an ounce of most snack foods.</p>
<p>Fresh, frozen, canned, and dried fruit and fruit juices are  on the fruit list.&nbsp; In general, one fruit  exchange is one small to medium fresh fruit; 1/2 cup of canned or fresh fruit  or fruit juice; or 1/4 cup of dried fruit.</p>
<p>Different types of milk and milk products, such as yogurt  are on the milk list.&nbsp; One cup (8 oz.) of  fat-free milk or 2/3 cup (6 oz.) of fat-free or low-fat flavored yogurt  sweetened with a non-nutritive sweetner are examples of one exchange.&nbsp;&nbsp; Skim and reduced fat milks are recommended  for adults and children over two years old, rather than whole milk.</p>
<p>The vegetable list includes all fresh, frozen, and dried  vegetables.&nbsp; Although three servings of  vegetables are the equivalent of one starch serving, we count vegetables  separately to encourage more consumption of them.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  Meat and meat substitutes that contain both protein and fat  are on the meat list.&nbsp; In general, one  exchange is one ounce of meat, fish, poultry, cheese, and 1/2 cup of  beans.&nbsp; Meat choices for the very lean or  lean meat lists are encouraged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One fat exchange is one teaspoon of regular margarine, mayo,  or vegetable oil; one tablespoon of regular salad dressing or reduced-fat mayo;  or two tablespoons of reduced fat salad dressings. When possible,  monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fats should be substituted for saturated  fats.</p>
<p>Some foods are in one list, but they may fit in another  list.&nbsp; For example, foods in the starch,  fruit, and milk lists, each contribute similar amounts of carbohydrates and  calories and may be interchanged.&nbsp;  However, if fruits or starches are regularly substituted for milk,  calcium intake may be decreased.&nbsp;  Conversely, regularly choosing milk instead of fruits and starches may  result in inadequate fiber intake.</p>
<p>Foods from the &ldquo;other&rdquo; starch list (desserts, fast food) are  also interchangeable with the fruit and milk list. These items are usually  higher in sugar and fat and need to be eaten within the context of a healthy  meal plan.</p>
<p>Beans, peas, and lentils are included in the starch  list.&nbsp; The serving size of a 1/2 cup is  counted as one starch and one very lean meat for vegetarian meal planning.&nbsp; If individuals are not practicing vegetarians  or use these foods more as side dishes rather than main dishes, the very lean  meat exchange is not counted (1/2 cup would equal only 1 starch).</p>

<p>For example, if you look at the exchange list for a 1,600  calorie diet, you see the set amount of food that may be consumed, broken down  by exchange.&nbsp; We recommend dividing these  exchanges into 3 meals and 2-3 snacks to provide a balance of nutrition  throughout the day. </p>
<p><u>Breakfast:</u><br />
  1 starch <br />
  1 fruit <br />
  1 milk <br />
  1 meat <br />
  1 fat </p>
<p><u>Mid-morning snack:</u><br />
  1 starch <br />
  1 fat </p>
<p><u>Lunch:</u><br />
  2 starches <br />
  3 meats <br />
  2 fats <br />
  1 vegetable </p>
<p><u>Mid-afternoon snack:</u><br />
  1 fruit <br />
  1 meat <br />
  1 fat </p>
<p><u>Dinner:</u><br />
  2 starches <br />
  3 proteins <br />
  2 vegetables <br />
  2 fats </p>
<p><u>Evening snack:</u><br />
  1 starch <br />
  1 milk </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The exchange-meal plan allows for choices and flexibility.&nbsp; For example, you may want to move a fruit  from one meal to another, just remember to keep your meals balanced (spread  your exchanges out fairly evenly throughout the day).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In each 2 week period, we will provide you with 2 sample  meal plans (choose the meal plans closest to your daily calorie needs) to give  you an example of what a typical day of eating based on our recommendations  would entail.&nbsp; These meal plans are to  serve as a sample way to eat throughout the week, they do not need to be  followed exactly day after day. Due to personal food preferences or food  allergies, you may need to make alternate food choices at times.</p>
<p>During each 2 week block, we will also provide you with  education on and recommendations for one specific area of nutrition.&nbsp; Our hope is that you will use that 2 week  period to focus on and improve upon this area, and then apply it on an ongoing  basis when making your food choices.</p>
<p>We recommend keeping a daily food log to track your  intake.&nbsp; The log will serve as an  accountability tool and an evaluation tool, should the need arise for  adjustments to be made in your meal plan.</p>
