        <br />
        Initially, we  will keep things simple. We will teach 11 exercises, along with 2 optional  movements. 
        The workouts will not vary for the first four weeks as you strive to  develop consistency. The first 
        month is your foundation phase. In the future  weeks, we will introduce variations and add changes to 
        your program. So let’s  get started and have some fun!
        <br /><br />
        <div class="subTitle">Weights, Repetitions and Pace</div>
         <br />
       
              If you are new  to Weight training or have not worked out for some time, you may have to  experiment with selecting the proper weight for each exercise. Always remember,  it is more important to perform an exercise properly and safely than struggle  with too much weight. If you train consistently  and safely, you will become stronger. If you focus on proper form and safety,  the risk of injury is less likely. Gains in fitness are made through  consistency and progression.
              <br /><br />In this  routine, perform 2 sets of each exercise. The exercises should be performed on  machines. Later on, we will incorporate free weights and dumbbells. Perform 10-15  repetitions for each set. In the first set, strive to complete 15 repetitions.  In the second set, aim for 15 reps, but perform a minimum of 10 repetitions.  Don’t worry if you are experiencing difficulty. Progress will come with each  workout.
              <br /><br />In the initial  workout, be conservative with weight selection, especially on the first set of  each exercise. You should be able to tell within a few repetitions whether you  can complete 15 reps. If the weight is too heavy, take some weight off and  concentrate on form. If the weight is too light, complete the set,  concentrating on form. In the next set, add more weight. Within a few workouts,  you should have a clearer understanding of this process.
              <br /><br />When you are able to perform 15 repetitions  for both sets, it is time to increase the weight setting. Again, be sure to  perform both sets using proper form before adding additional weight. Form  first, weight second.
              <br /><br />Each set should  take approximately 1 minute to perform. Take a 1 minute recovery between sets  and exercises. The entire routine should not extend beyond 45 minutes. However,  if you are able, take less time between sets and increase the cardiovascular  benefit by keeping your heart rate level higher throughout your workout. <br />
           <br /><br />
           
            <div class="subTitle">Expectations</div>
            <br />
              If you are  beginning an exercise program for the first time or after an extended period of  time, you may experience some soreness after a workout. This should taper over  time. Soreness goes away in a couple of days, but pain lingers. It’s important  to know the difference. Please don’t ever train through pain - see  your doctor.
              <br /><br />Muscles should feel tired after a workout. Initially,  your workouts should not be intense as you are learning new exercises.  As you progress and intensity increases,  expect to feel tired at the end of your workouts. Always remember to eat well,  and get proper rest. If you follow this formula, expect to get stronger.
              <br /><br />Once workouts  become more challenging, you may find yourself breathing hard, as if running or  climbing stairs. This is to be expected. A strength training workout can be  “aerobic”, since muscles are requiring oxygen, similar to a cardio workout.  Don’t shy away from this - go for it!
              <br /><br />If you remain  consistent, eventually you will build muscle. Consider this to be a positive  occurrence. If you are concerned about weight gain, muscle will help you to  burn more body fat. Keep this in mind if you get on the scale. Progress is not  made overnight.
              <br /><br />One more  thing...have fun!
