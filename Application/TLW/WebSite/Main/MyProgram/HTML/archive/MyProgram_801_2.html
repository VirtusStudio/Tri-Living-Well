        <div class="title">Strength Training Tri Level Stage 2</div>
        <br />
        Initially, we  will keep things simple. We will teach 11 exercises, along with 2 optional  movements. 
        The workouts will not vary for the first four weeks as you strive to  develop consistency. The first 
        month is your foundation phase. In the future  weeks, we will introduce variations and add changes to 
        your program. So let’s  get started and have some fun!
        <br /><br />
        <div class="subTitle">Weights, Repetitions and Pace</div>
         <br />
       
              If you are new  to Weight training or have not worked out for some time, you may have to  experiment with selecting the proper weight for each exercise. Always remember,  it is more important to perform an exercise properly and safely than struggle  with too much weight. If you train consistently  and safely, you will become stronger. If you focus on proper form and safety,  the risk of injury is less likely. Gains in fitness are made through  consistency and progression.
              <br /><br />In this  routine, perform 2 sets of each exercise. The exercises should be performed on  machines. Later on, we will incorporate free weights and dumbbells. Perform 10-15  repetitions for each set. In the first set, strive to complete 15 repetitions.  In the second set, aim for 15 reps, but perform a minimum of 10 repetitions.  Don’t worry if you are experiencing difficulty. Progress will come with each  workout.
              <br /><br />In the initial  workout, be conservative with weight selection, especially on the first set of  each exercise. You should be able to tell within a few repetitions whether you  can complete 15 reps. If the weight is too heavy, take some weight off and  concentrate on form. If the weight is too light, complete the set,  concentrating on form. In the next set, add more weight. Within a few workouts,  you should have a clearer understanding of this process.
              <br /><br />When you are able to perform 15 repetitions  for both sets, it is time to increase the weight setting. Again, be sure to  perform both sets using proper form before adding additional weight. Form  first, weight second.
              <br /><br />Each set should  take approximately 1 minute to perform. Take a 1 minute recovery between sets  and exercises. The entire routine should not extend beyond 45 minutes. However,  if you are able, take less time between sets and increase the cardiovascular  benefit by keeping your heart rate level higher throughout your workout. <br />
           <br /><br />
           
            <div class="subTitle">Expectations</div>
            <br />
              If you are  beginning an exercise program for the first time or after an extended period of  time, you may experience some soreness after a workout. This should taper over  time. Soreness goes away in a couple of days, but pain lingers. It’s important  to know the difference. Please don’t ever train through pain - see  your doctor.
              <br /><br />Muscles should feel tired after a workout. Initially,  your workouts should not be intense as you are learning new exercises.  As you progress and intensity increases,  expect to feel tired at the end of your workouts. Always remember to eat well,  and get proper rest. If you follow this formula, expect to get stronger.
              <br /><br />Once workouts  become more challenging, you may find yourself breathing hard, as if running or  climbing stairs. This is to be expected. A strength training workout can be  “aerobic”, since muscles are requiring oxygen, similar to a cardio workout.  Don’t shy away from this - go for it!
              <br /><br />If you remain  consistent, eventually you will build muscle. Consider this to be a positive  occurrence. If you are concerned about weight gain, muscle will help you to  burn more body fat. Keep this in mind if you get on the scale. Progress is not  made overnight.
              <br /><br />One more  thing...have fun!

  Sit  in the machine so that your lower back is well supported, against the back pad.  If the pad is adjustable, 
  set it so that your “sit bones” line up over the axes  of rotation of the movements arms. In other words, look 
  under the seat, align  the two rotation points in a vertical line with your “sit bones”. If you have a  slender 
  build, set the back pad as far back as it can go or in a  vertical position. If you have a large build, place 
  the back pad in a horizontal position. Once your position is established,  squeeze your legs together, causing 
  the movement arms to meet. If you are  unable to get the movement arms to meet, reduce the weight until you can 
  achieve  full range of motion.  After a short  pause in the middle/contracted position, slowly lower the weight, 
  moving your  legs apart into the stretched position. Do this slowly to minimize potential  soreness and/or injury.<br />

  Position  yourself in the machine so that your back is well supported, against the back pad 
  (including lower back). If you have a slender build, set the back pad  completely or nearly vertical. If you have 
  a large build, you’ll usually set  the back pad down toward horizontal. Once your position is established, press  
  the outside of your thighs against the pads on the movement arms, and press  until you reach the maximum range 
  of motion possible. Avoid arching your back  to achieve additional range of motion. If your machine is designed 
  with foot  rests, avoid pressing your feet down against the footrests. Pause briefly at  your maximum range of 
  motion, then move slowly back inward. Do not allow the weight  to come to rest. Repeat.<br />

  Position the  back pad of the machine with your knee aligned with the axis of the machine’s  rotation. 
  If possible, adjust the shin pad to a position near the ankle, but  not on top of the foot. (It may take some 
  trial and error to find a comfortable  spot). If your leg extension machine has a seat belt, adjust it so 
  that it  holds your hips down firmly.<br />
  <br />There will  likely be handles on each side of the seat; for now, grip them lightly. Slowly lift the 
  weight by extending your legs, until you reach the highest point your  range of motion will allow (to help 
  you reach this point, grip the handles more  firmly, and pull yourself down into the seat as you approach 
  the top). Pause  briefly in the fully extended position (approximately one second), and lower  under control. 
  Just before you reach bottom (the lifted weight sits down on top  of the rest of the stack), repeat.<br />
  <br />
   Note: the ideal top  position will be one of full extension. There are a couple of reasons why you 
   might not reach this position, however: 1 - you may have a knee issue, which  you will have already 
   discussed with your doctor. If your doctor advises you to  stop short of full extension, please follow 
   his/her advice. 2 - some machines  are constructed in such a way that the top position feels incredibly 
   heavy. In  order to reach full extension on such a machine, you might need to reduce the  weight so 
   drastically as to make the exercise too easy. In such a case, you’ll  need to select a weight that 
   represents a “happy medium” and get the greatest  range of motion possible on your machine.<br />

                      Position  the machine so that your knee lines up with the axis of rotation of the  machine, similar to the position described for the leg extension. The leg pad  should be low on the leg, above the Achilles tendon, but not fully on the calf.  Similar to the leg extension, your machine will likely have handles on either  side of the seat; please use these to help keep your hips and low back stable.  Flex your feet so that your toes point toward your knees. Begin by slowly  bending your knees, pulling your hips back toward your butt. When you have  reached the point of greatest contraction, pause briefly, and then slowly  extend your legs again. Just before you set the weight stack down, repeat.<br />

                      This  will likely be one of (if not the most) the most demanding exercises in your  workout, as it works a lot of muscle. Be conservative with weight and intensity  increases on this one. If possible, set your seat so that, when you extend your  legs, you stop just short of locking out your knees. This will help keep  continuous tension on the leg muscles. If your leg press allows you to change  the angle of the back pad, experiment. A more upright position tends to  concentrate the work on the quadriceps (front of the thigh), while a more  reclined position tends to get the hamstrings and gluteus muscles more  involved, along with the quadriceps.   Once you are set, slowly and steadily extend your legs, until you reach  the stopping point of the machine, or until you are just short of locking your  knees out. There is no need for a pause in this position; simply turn the  movement around, slowly and smoothly, until your legs are bent 90 degrees.  Avoid bringing your legs back past this point, as your hips will usually  elevate, and when it is time to press the weight out again, your lower back  will be called upon to pull the hips back down. This is an unsafe position for  the lower back to have to work in.<br />

                      If  the chest pad of your machine is adjustable, set it so that your arms can fully  extend, but so that you only have a slight reach beyond this. This will enable  you to easily set the weight down when your set is over. Most people start this  movement with their arms, which means they get a great biceps (and to some  degree, shoulder) workout, but not much back work. Try instead to initiate  things by drawing your shoulders back and inward. This doesn’t always come  naturally, so try this (without using any weight): imagine someone has their  hand on your back. Try to squeeze the hand with your shoulder blades. Do this a  few times, until you feel like you have some control over this movement, then  do the same thing on the row machine. Grip the handles with your hands, draw  your shoulders back and your shoulder blades inward. Once you have drawn  shoulders and shoulder blades as far back and in as possible, finish the  movement by bending your arms/drawing your elbows back behind you. Don’t lean  back and away from the chest pad, as this transfers the work from the upper  back/shoulders/arms to the lower back. Once you’ve reached the point where you  can no longer draw your elbows back any farther, pause in this contracted  position for a moment. Then, extend your arms again, slowly and under control,  until straight. Repeat until your set is finished.<br />

                      If  your machine allows you to adjust your seat height, set this so that when you  pull the handle(s) down toward your chest, they come to a pause at the  mid/lower part of the chest. Grip the handles <em>so that your palms face you</em>. Similar to the machine row, try to  start the movement by moving the shoulders; this time, you’ll move the  shoulders and shoulder blades down, rather than back and inward. Once the  shoulders have moved as  much as  possible, complete the movement by bending the arms and drawing the elbows  behind you. Pause for a moment in the bottom/contracted position, then extend  the arms again, slowly and steadily. Repeat until the set is finished.<br />

                      Position  yourself so that your back is fully supported, firmly against the back pad,  including your lower back. If the seat height on your machine is adjustable,  set this so that the handles are at or slightly below shoulder height (Note: if  you have, or have had, shoulder issues, it may be better to lower the seat a  bit, and set the handles slightly above shoulder height. Please check with your  doctor). If a choice of hand positions is offered, use the handles that allow  your elbows to be closer to your torso. Once you are set, simply press the  weight upward, stopping just short of locking out your elbows. Slowly and  smoothly lower the weight. Just before you reach the absolute bottom position,  press upward again. Repeat until your set is finished.<br />

                      If  possible, position the seat so that your shoulders are level with, or slightly  below your elbows (this will vary, depending on machine design). Try to keep  your shoulders down throughout the movement. Slowly and steadily, contract your  abs, moving into a “crunch” position. Focus on curling the torso, rather than  “bowing” forward. When you reach the point at which you can no longer curl the  torso (point of greatest contraction), slowly and smoothly move in the other  direction. Repeat until your set is finished. Note: it is very common to do  this movement very quickly. For best results, and safety, <em>please do this movement slowly, in both directions.</em><br />

                      <strong>Hip  Flexion/Leg Raise</strong></span><br />This can be  performed on a machine, sitting on the end of a bench, or on a leg raise  stand/station. For beginners, use either a machine (not so common these days)  or sit on the end of a bench. Place your hands on the bench, just behind you, for  support. Then, simply lift your knees toward your chest, as far as you can go.  Then, gradually straighten your legs and repeat.</p>
                    On a leg raise  station, step up on the steps of the machine, and place your back against the  back pad. Place your forearms on the pads to either side of you, and lightly  grip the handles. Take your feet off the steps, supporting your weight with  your arms and shoulders. Raise your knees up toward your chest, as high as you  can, and lower until straight. If you can, keep your legs slightly in front of  you, in order to keep tension on the hip flexors at all times. Note: it is very  common to do this movement very quickly. For best results, and safety, <em>please do this movement slowly, in both  directions.</em><br />
