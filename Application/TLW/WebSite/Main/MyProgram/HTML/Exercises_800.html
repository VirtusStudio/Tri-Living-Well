  Sit  in the machine so that your lower back is well supported, against the back pad.  If the pad is adjustable, 
  set it so that your “sit bones” line up over the axes  of rotation of the movements arms. In other words, look 
  under the seat, align  the two rotation points in a vertical line with your “sit bones”. If you have a  slender 
  build, set the back pad as far back as it can go or in a  vertical position. If you have a large build, place 
  the back pad in a horizontal position. Once your position is established,  squeeze your legs together, causing 
  the movement arms to meet. If you are  unable to get the movement arms to meet, reduce the weight until you can 
  achieve  full range of motion.  After a short  pause in the middle/contracted position, slowly lower the weight, 
  moving your  legs apart into the stretched position. Do this slowly to minimize potential  soreness and/or injury.<br />

  Position  yourself in the machine so that your back is well supported, against the back pad 
  (including lower back). If you have a slender build, set the back pad  completely or nearly vertical. If you have 
  a large build, you’ll usually set  the back pad down toward horizontal. Once your position is established, press  
  the outside of your thighs against the pads on the movement arms, and press  until you reach the maximum range 
  of motion possible. Avoid arching your back  to achieve additional range of motion. If your machine is designed 
  with foot  rests, avoid pressing your feet down against the footrests. Pause briefly at  your maximum range of 
  motion, then move slowly back inward. Do not allow the weight  to come to rest. Repeat.<br />

Position the  back pad of the machine with your knee aligned with the axis of the machine&rsquo;s  rotation. 
  If possible, adjust the shin pad to a position near the ankle, but  not on top of the foot. (It may take some 
  trial and error to find a comfortable  spot). If your leg extension machine has a seat belt, adjust it so 
  that it  holds your hips down firmly.<br />
  <br />
  There will  likely be handles on each side of the seat; for now, grip them lightly. Slowly lift the 
  weight by extending your legs, until you reach the highest point your  range of motion will allow (to help 
  you reach this point, grip the handles more  firmly, and pull yourself down into the seat as you approach 
  the top). Pause  briefly in the fully extended position (approximately one second), and lower  under control. 
  Just before you reach bottom (the lifted weight sits down on top  of the rest of the stack), repeat.<br />
  <br />
Note: the ideal top  position will be one of full extension. There are a couple of reasons why you 
   might not reach this position, however: 1 - you may have a knee issue, which  you will have already 
   discussed with your doctor. If your doctor advises you to  stop short of full extension, please follow 
   his/her advice. 2 - some machines  are constructed in such a way that the top position feels incredibly 
   heavy. In  order to reach full extension on such a machine, you might need to reduce the  weight so 
   drastically as to make the exercise too easy. In such a case, you&rsquo;ll  need to select a weight that 
   represents a &ldquo;happy medium&rdquo; and get the greatest  range of motion possible on your machine.<br />

The leg pad  should be low on the leg, above the Achilles tendon, but not fully on the calf.  Similar to the leg extension, your machine will likely have handles on either  side of the seat; please use these to help keep your hips and low back stable.  Flex your feet so that your toes point toward your knees. Begin by slowly  bending your knees, pulling your hips back toward your butt. When you have  reached the point of greatest contraction, pause briefly, and then slowly  extend your legs again. Just before you set the weight stack down, repeat.</span><br />

      <span class="style25">This  will likely be one of (if not the most) the most demanding exercises in your  workout, as it works a lot of muscle. Be conservative with weight and intensity  increases on this one. If possible, set your seat so that, when you extend your  legs, you stop just short of locking out your knees. This will help keep  continuous tension on the leg muscles. If your leg press allows you to change  the angle of the back pad, experiment. A more upright position tends to  concentrate the work on the quadriceps (front of the thigh), while a more  reclined position tends to get the hamstrings and gluteus muscles more  involved, along with the quadriceps.&nbsp;  Once you are set, slowly and steadily extend your legs, until you reach  the stopping point of the machine, or until you are just short of locking your  knees out. There is no need for a pause in this position; simply turn the  movement around, slowly and smoothly, until your legs are bent 90 degrees.  Avoid bringing your legs back past this point, as your hips will usually  elevate, and when it is time to press the weight out again, your lower back  will be called upon to pull the hips back down. This is an unsafe position for  the lower back to have to work in.</span><br />

     <span class="style25">If  the chest pad of your machine is adjustable, set it so that your arms can fully  extend, but so that you only have a slight reach beyond this. This will enable  you to easily set the weight down when your set is over. Most people start this  movement with their arms, which means they get a great biceps (and to some  degree, shoulder) workout, but not much back work. Try instead to initiate  things by drawing your shoulders back and inward. This doesn&rsquo;t always come  naturally, so try this (without using any weight): imagine someone has their  hand on your back. Try to squeeze the hand with your shoulder blades. Do this a  few times, until you feel like you have some control over this movement, then  do the same thing on the row machine. Grip the handles with your hands, draw  your shoulders back and your shoulder blades inward. Once you have drawn  shoulders and shoulder blades as far back and in as possible, finish the  movement by bending your arms/drawing your elbows back behind you. Don&rsquo;t lean  back and away from the chest pad, as this transfers the work from the upper  back/shoulders/arms to the lower back. Once you&rsquo;ve reached the point where you  can no longer draw your elbows back any farther, pause in this contracted  position for a moment. Then, extend your arms again, slowly and under control,  until straight. Repeat until your set is finished.</span><br />
